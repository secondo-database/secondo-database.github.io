2012-10-31 Notes on Release 3.3.0
===============================================================================

New algebra modules:
--------------------

* SymbolicTrajectoryAlgebra:
     This algebra manages time-dependent strings and provides a pattern matching on such structures.

* OSM Algebra
     The OSM Algebra provides import functions for Open Street Map data.

* Map Matching Algebra
     This algebra provides methods to map moving points to an underlying network.

* Hadoop, HadoopParallel Algebra
    These algebras provide mechanisms for parallel execution of queries on several computers.

* Distributed Algebra
    This algebra is an alternative approach for using Secondo in parallel.

* Trie Algebra
    The Trie algebra provides inverted files as an index structure for large documents.

* GroupBy Algebra
    This algebra provides a hash based group by operation.


Optimizer Extension
-------------------
The optimizer now can handle queries with an arbitrary number of relations and predicates.

Main Memory Management
----------------------
Instead of assigning a fixed amount of main memory to each operator, Secondo's QueryProcessor now
distributes the available memory to all operators asking for it.

Query Construction Viewer
-------------------------
This new viewer helps users to formulate queries.

Extensions of Algebras
-----------------------
Algebra modules were extended by new types and operators, e.g., for searching for regular expressions
within texts. 


Adaption to new Operating Systems
----------------------------------

Secondo Version 3.3.0 works with SuSe 12.2 and Ubuntu 12.04.
