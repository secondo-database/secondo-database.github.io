                    **** SECONDO Release Notes ****

2008-12-18 Notes on Release 2.8.2

===============================================================================
A feedproject operator which combines feed and project has been made fully 
available, that is, integrated into query optimization and equipped with 
progress estimation. For relations with many attributes, feedproject is 
much faster than separate feed and project.

Bugfix for the updateRel predicate of the optimizer.
