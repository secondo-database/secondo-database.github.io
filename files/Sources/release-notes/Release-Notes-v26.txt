2007-10-25 Notes on Release 2.6 
===============================================================================

This version contains some bug fixes and a new algebra module called
"SimulationAlgebra".

In order to use this you may need to update your system, since we need now
the GNU Scientific Library (GSL). Please install this library on your
system (also the gsl-devel package). However, if you don't need this algebra
uncomment the modules.

 * SimulationAlgebra 
 * GSLAlgebra
