This document describes how to create an environment able to
compile Secondo on a freshly installed Fedora 31. The user installing the SDK 
must be a 'sudoer'.

 (1) Make sure that your system is up to date.
 (2) Connect to the internet.
 (3) Open a terminal
 (4) Install wget
     sudo yum install wget
 (5) Navigate to your HOME directory
     cd $HOME
 (6) Download the installation script
     wget http://dna.fernuni-hagen.de/secondo/files/Installation/Fedora/SecondoOnFedora31.sh
 (7) Start the script: 
     bash SecondoOnFedora31.sh
     The script will install additional packages required for compiling Secondo.
     Thus it will ask for the sudo password.
     (If you don't trust the script, you can also install the required software manually).
     Furthermore, the script will create a file .secondorc in your home 
     directory.
      
 (8) Download and unpack the Secondo source code, so that it is rooted at
     a directory ~/secondo. If you choose an other directory for the source 
     root, you need to adapt the command in the next step. 
 (9) Add the following entry into the file $HOME/.bashrc file:

  source ~/.secondorc $HOME/secondo


Now, you are finally able to compile Secondo (see Secondo User's Manual).
