Secondo Installation on Mavericks / Yosemite
=============================================


This document describes how to install Secondo on OS X Mavericks.
This guide works also with version Yosemite.

Firstly, the xcode command line tools must be installed. For that, 
open a Terminal (Applications->Utilities->Terminal) and enter:

gcc --version

If xcode is already installed, the compiler's version is displayed.
Otherwise, a window pops up informing that the xcode is necessary 
for the gcc-command. Just click "install" and wait for some time.

The next step is the installation of the Java Development Kit.
In the terminal enter:
  javac -version

If Java is installed, the version number is printed out. Otherwise,
a new window appears. By clicking on "install", the web browser is
opened showing Oracle's Java download page. Accept the license, download 
the JDK for Mac OS X, and install it.

Now it's time to install the Secondo environment and Secondo itself.
Download the Mavericks SDK from:

  http://dna.fernuni-hagen.de/secondo/files/Installation/Mac/SDK_OSX_MAVERICKS.zip

If not done automatically, unpack the file. Within the terminal, navigate 
to the SDK's directory. Enter:
   ./Install_On_Maverick

Wait for some time. After the installation finished, open the file .profile within 
your home directory with a text editor. Ensure that this file contains the following
lines:

export SECONDO_SDK=$HOME/secondo-sdk
export SECONDO_PLATFORM=max_osx
export SECONDO_BUILD_DIR=$HOME/secondo
source $SECONDO_SDK/secondorc

Save the file if changes were performed and close the text editor.

Close the terminal and open a new one. 
The terminal shows some configuration information. Navigate to Secondo's 
main directory: 
  cd secondo
and enter
  make

Wait for a while. 
Now you can start Secondo (See User Manual).


All changes made by the SDK installation are local to the user. 
To remove the Secondo SDK, just remove the secondo-sdk directory
within the home directory. For removing secondo, remove the directories
secondo and secondo-databases from your home directory.
