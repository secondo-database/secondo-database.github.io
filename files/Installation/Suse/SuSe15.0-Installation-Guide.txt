This document describes how to create an environment able to
compile Secondo on a freshly installed Open SuSe Linux Leap 42.1.

 (1) Make sure that your system is up to date.
 (2) Connect to the internet.
 (3) Download the installation script
       http://dna.fernuni-hagen.de/secondo/files/Installation/Suse/secondoSDK_Suse_15_0.bash
 (4) Start the script: 
     open a terminal, enter the directory where the script is stored and enter:
     bash secondoSDK_Suse_15_0.bash
     The script will install additional packages required for compiling Secondo.
     Thus it will ask for root's password.
     (If you don't trust the script, you can also install the required software manually).
     Furthermore, the script will create a file .secondorc in your home 
     directory.
     If all required tools are already installed, e.g. by a Secondo installation of another
     user then start the script with the -onlyrc arguments, i.e.,
     bash secondoSDK_Suse_15_0.bash -onlyrc
 (5) At the end of the script, some instructions how to install the Berkeley DB 
     are printed out. Just follow these instructions to finish the
     Secondo-SDK installation.
      
 (6) Download and unpack the Secondo source code, so that it is rooted at
     a directory ~/secondo. If you choose an other directory for the source 
     root, you need to adapt the command in the next step. 
     (For SuSe 15.0 at least version 4.1.2 is needed.)

 (6) Add the following entry into the file $HOME/.bashrc file:

  source ~/.secondorc $HOME/secondo


Now, you are finally able to compile Secondo (see Secondo User's Manual).
