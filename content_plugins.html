<h1><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Secondo</span> Plugins</h1>
<h2>Basic Idea</h2>
<span style="font-variant:small-caps">Secondo</span> is extensible in many ways. One can provide a new algebra, new viewers,
new display classes, and extensions of the optimizer. 
A <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Secondo</span> plugin is a package of such extensions provided as a single zip-file. 
Besides the parts containing the source code (i.e. source files and code sections),
a plugin contains an XML file containing information about where the new code is to
place, the name of the extension etc. This allows for an automatical installation
of an extension  using a tool which is part of a <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Secondo</span> distribution. 
So, if the inventor of a new data structure or of a new
algorithm provides it as a <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Secondo</span> plugin, other researchers can compare their solutions
with this approach without the effort of reimplementing the algorithms/data structures. 
<p>
A main motivation for this is to better support <a href="content_plugin_motivation.html">experimental research in databases</a>. 


<h2>Current Restrictions</h2> 

In the current state, only standard extensions are possible. If changes at the kernel are
required to implement a new approach, the plugin mechanism  is not sufficient.  
Further, non-solved problems are name conflicts. For example, if two plugins provide each a 
new algebra containing a same-named data type, the plugins cannot be installed at the same
time. A similar problem occurs if two new algebras provide new operators having the 
same signature. From the view of the gui, it's not allowed to overwrite existing classes. 

<h2>Installing Plugins</h2>

Before installing a new plugin ensure to have a running <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Secondo</span> system. Additionally to
the plugin to install, you need the following two files (these files are also created 
by typing <code>make</code> in the <code>$SECONDO_BUILD_DIR/Tools/extensionInstaller</code>
directory in <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Secondo</span> version 2.9.0 or later):
<ul>
  <li> <a href="files/Binaries/Installer.jar">Installer.jar</a></li>
  <li> <a href="files/Binaries/secinstall">secinstall</a></li>
</ul>
and a running Java environment (version 1.5 or above). Just copy both files into the directory
of your choice, let us call it X. Then proceed as follows:

<ol>
  <li>Ensure that the system variable <code>SECONDO_BUILD_DIR</code> points
to the root directory of your <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Secondo</span> installation. 
To make sure this is the case,  
open a bash (or an msys-shell on Windows), navigate to that <code>secondo</code> directory, and type
<pre>
 setvar $PWD
</pre>
  <li>Navigate in a bash or msys shell to the directory X where you put the installer.
  <li>Now install the plugin by entering the following line
<pre>
 secinstall &lt;filename&gt;
</pre>
where <code>filename</code> is the name of the zip file containing the plugin. If there
are any dependencies between plugins, i.e. plugin <i>A</i> requires an already installed
plugin <i>B</i>, both plugins can be installed at the same time just by extending the command
above by further file names.
</ol>

After installing the plugin, the system has to be recompiled.  

<h2>Available Plugins</h2>

The following plugins are currently available.
<ul>
  <li>Nearest Neighbor</li>
  <li>TB-Tree</li>
  <li>X-Tree and M-Tree</li>
  <li>Periodic</li>
  <li>Spatiotemporal Pattern Queries</li>
</ul>
